Source - Base source class
==========================


.. _core_source_abstract_methods:

Abstract Methods
----------------
For loading and configuration purposes, Sources must implement the
:ref:`Plugin base class abstract methods <core_plugin_abstract_methods>`.

.. attention::

   In order to ensure that all configuration data is processed at
   load time, it is important that all URLs have been processed during
   :func:`Plugin.configure() <buildstream.plugin.Plugin.configure>`.

   Source implementations *must* either call
   :func:`Source.translate_url() <buildstream.source.Source.translate_url>` or
   :func:`Source.mark_download_url() <buildstream.source.Source.mark_download_url>`
   for every URL that has been specified in the configuration during
   :func:`Plugin.configure() <buildstream.plugin.Plugin.configure>`

Sources expose the following abstract methods. Unless explicitly mentioned,
these methods are mandatory to implement.

* :func:`Source.get_consistency() <buildstream.source.Source.get_consistency>`

  Report the sources consistency state.

* :func:`Source.load_ref() <buildstream.source.Source.load_ref>`

  Load the ref from a specific YAML node

* :func:`Source.get_ref() <buildstream.source.Source.get_ref>`

  Fetch the source ref

* :func:`Source.set_ref() <buildstream.source.Source.set_ref>`

  Set a new ref explicitly

* :func:`Source.track() <buildstream.source.Source.track>`

  Automatically derive a new ref from a symbolic tracking branch

* :func:`Source.fetch() <buildstream.source.Source.fetch>`

  Fetch the actual payload for the currently set ref

* :func:`Source.stage() <buildstream.source.Source.stage>`

  Stage the sources for a given ref at a specified location

* :func:`Source.init_workspace() <buildstream.source.Source.init_workspace>`

  Stage sources in a local directory for use as a workspace.

  **Optional**: If left unimplemented, this will default to calling
  :func:`Source.stage() <buildstream.source.Source.stage>`

* :func:`Source.get_source_fetchers() <buildstream.source.Source.get_source_fetchers>`

  Get the objects that are used for fetching.

  **Optional**: This only needs to be implemented for sources that need to
  download from multiple URLs while fetching (e.g. a git repo and its
  submodules). For details on how to define a SourceFetcher, see
  :ref:`SourceFetcher <core_source_fetcher>`.

* :func:`Source.validate_cache() <buildstream.source.Source.validate_cache>`

  Perform any validations which require the sources to be cached.

  **Optional**: This is completely optional and will do nothing if left unimplemented.

Accessing previous sources
--------------------------
*Since: 1.4*

In the general case, all sources are fetched and tracked independently of one
another. In situations where a source needs to access previous source(s) in
order to perform its own track and/or fetch, following attributes can be set to
request access to previous sources:

* :attr:`~buildstream.source.Source.BST_REQUIRES_PREVIOUS_SOURCES_TRACK`

  Indicate that access to previous sources is required during track

* :attr:`~buildstream.source.Source.BST_REQUIRES_PREVIOUS_SOURCES_FETCH`

  Indicate that access to previous sources is required during fetch

The intended use of such plugins is to fetch external dependencies of other
sources, typically using some kind of package manager, such that all the
dependencies of the original source(s) are available at build time.

When implementing such a plugin, implementors should adhere to the following
guidelines:

* Implementations must be able to store the obtained artifacts in a
  subdirectory.

* Implementations must be able to deterministically generate a unique ref, such
  that two refs are different if and only if they produce different outputs.

* Implementations must not introduce host contamination.


.. _core_source_fetcher:

SourceFetcher - Object for fetching individual URLs
===================================================


Abstract Methods
----------------
SourceFetchers expose the following abstract methods. Unless explicitly
mentioned, these methods are mandatory to implement.

* :func:`SourceFetcher.fetch() <buildstream.source.SourceFetcher.fetch>`

  Fetches the URL associated with this SourceFetcher, optionally taking an
  alias override.
